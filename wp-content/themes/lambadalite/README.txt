== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I add an EDD shop =

Activate [Easy Digital Downloads](https://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-digital-downloads/) plugin.

Add a few products via Dashboard/Downloads/Add new.

The shop's archive can be found at `/downloads`. Example: `https://yourwebsite.com/downloads`.

== I get "page not found" when trying to access Downloads page

If you can't see this page, you should reset the permalinks. To do that, please, navigate to  Settings/Permalinks and only click the "save" button without doing anything else. Now you can check `https://yourwebsite.com/downloads` page again. You should be able to see the shop now.

== Can I have my own custom page for shop though? ==

Yes. Add a new page via Dashboard/Pages with shortcode `[downloads pagination="true" number="3"]` . Select the `freestyle` template from Page Attributes.
