Automatically login new user right after they have registered. Add Password field to registration form. Disable admin notification emails of new user registrations and user password resets. Allow redirect of new user to any page right after they have registered. Add Firstname and Lastname field to registration form.

== Description ==

This plugin has the following great features:

- Auto-login: When a new user registers, this will automatically log them in right away.

- Redirect: Choose the web page you want them to be redirected too after they register and are auto-logged in.

- Independent options to add Password field to new user registration form, so users can create their password during registration instead of having to wait for an email and clicking the link in the email.

- Independent options to add First Name field and/or Last Name field to registration form.

- Independent option to disable the annoying admin notification emails about new user registrations. User will still receive their email about how to setup their password.

- Independent option to disable the annoying admin notification emails about users lost/changed password. User will still receive their email about how to reset their password.
